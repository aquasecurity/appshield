> **IMPORTANT:** This repository has been archived. All Rego policies have been migrated to https://github.com/aquasecurity/defsec - you can find them with the same directory structure, nested inside the `rules/` directory. The appshield image is still published to ghcr for now, but is completely interchangable with the defsec image, which you should use instead.

# Appshield

This repository is a collection of policies for detecting mis-configurations, specifically security issues, in configuration files and Infrastructure as Code definitions.
